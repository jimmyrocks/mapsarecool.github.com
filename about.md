* We have had this URL for a long time, but never did anything with it. We finally decided on a travel blog with lots of maps and photos. We hope you’ll follow us on some crazy journeys!
* Speaking of, who are "we" anyway?
    * Jimmy (primary map maker, secondary photographer)
    * Christine (primary photographer, secondary map maker)!
* Out of thousands (maybe millions?) of travel blogs, what makes ours worth following?  We’re pretty much fun, we travel a lot (sometimes to places you’ve never heard of), and we try to do it as cheap as we can without having to skip things we want to do.  We plan to share our travels to lesser-known destinations, tourist traps, and popular places that we happen to visit.  Posts will include photos and a map of noteworthy locations (ex: restaurants, scenic viewpoints, train stations).  We’ll also post some reviews of activities, restaurants, breweries, hotels, etc that we really like (or really don’t like)

PS: If there is positive response to this blog, we may even go back and write about some of our past adventures like Norway, Alaska, various parts of Canada, and others.  So… tell your friends!
